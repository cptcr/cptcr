## Professional Experience
I am currently employed as a plastic technologist at Krempel Industries Ltd. I have been in this role for a year and will be starting my second year in September. Although my initial aspiration was to become a software developer, I find this role fulfilling and it provides a solid foundation for my career in the plastics industry. This experience has given me a unique perspective on manufacturing processes and material science, skills that are invaluable in any technical field.

## Technical Skills

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language that I frequently use in my projects. Its ease of learning and extensive ecosystem make it my go-to choice for almost every project. I have used JavaScript to develop a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex web applications. My experience includes working with various JavaScript libraries and frameworks, which has honed my skills in front-end development.

### C++ on Arduino
Since attending Realschule, I have been actively using C++ in various Arduino projects. I have applied my knowledge of C++ to develop embedded systems and hardware interfaces. My technical final exam project was coded in C++, and I have shared most of the code used for LCD displays and other components in a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/cptcr/arduino). This experience has deepened my understanding of low-level programming and hardware integration.

### TypeScript
TypeScript is often used in Node.js packages due to its robust type-checking capabilities and ability to provide a solid development environment. My first NPM project, a lightweight and fast database, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cptcr/cptcr.db). This project involved designing a database system that is easy to use and efficient, highlighting my skills in both TypeScript and database management.

### Python
While I don't code in Python extensively, I am continuously learning it. Currently, I am working on a Discord bot, as it is a great project for learning various coding languages such as JavaScript, Java, and C++. Python's simplicity and versatility make it an excellent language for developing bots and automation scripts. I am exploring different libraries and frameworks within Python to expand my proficiency.

### Next.js and Angular
I am in the process of learning both Next.js and Angular. Next.js is popular among many programmers for its ease of use and performance benefits, while Angular is widely used in large companies for building robust web applications. By learning these frameworks, I aim to enhance my front-end development skills and stay current with industry standards.

### Discord.js and Sapphire Framework
Discord.js serves as the foundation for the more advanced Sapphire framework. Most of my projects are built using Discord.js, and they are available publicly on GitHub. My verified bot, [Nexus](https://github.com/cptcr/nexus), demonstrates my ability to create complex, interactive bots. Additionally, I have developed an advanced Discord bot handler that supports components, prefix commands, slash commands, events, and various database types (e.g., mongoose, redis). This project, available [here](https://github.com/cptcr/discord-bot-handler), showcases my expertise in creating scalable and maintainable bot architectures.

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
I occasionally create basic games and websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My open-source projects include a Pong game and an Aerospace Shooter game, which can be tested at [Pong](https://cptcr.cc/pong) and [Space Shooter](https://cptcr.cc/space). These projects highlight my ability to design and develop engaging web-based applications from scratch.

## Current Projects
- **Database System Using fs**: Developing a file system-based database to provide a lightweight and efficient data storage solution.
- **Nexus Discord Bot Using Discord.js**: Continuously improving my verified Discord bot to add new features and enhance user interaction.
- **Discord Bot Handler**: Creating a comprehensive handler for Discord bots that supports various functionalities and database integrations.
- **Web Games**: Designing and developing interactive web games that are accessible and fun to play.
- **APIs Using the Express npm Package**: Building RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between front-end applications and back-end services.
