## What do i work?
I work as plastic technologist for the company "Krempel Industries Ltd." and i learn the job since one year. In september i start with the 2nd year and i really enjoy the job even tho i wanted to start as software developer. But im happy with it and if i dont find a job in the IT branch i have a solid job base for another company which produces plastic.

# JavaScript
JavaScript is a very powerfull language and i use it very often in my projects. Almost every project is coded with it since its easy to learn and use. 

# C++ on Arduino
Since i went to the "Realschule" i use C++ in Arduino projects. I also coded my technical final exam with it. I published most of the code we used for LCD Displays and other stuff in a repository. You can find it here: https://github.com/cptcr/arduino

# TypeScript
TypeScript is often used in Node.js packages since it provides a great base to provide an NPM with TypeScript and JavaScript support. My first NPM project was a database which is leightweight, fast and easy to use. https://github.com/cptcr/cptcr.db

# Python
I dont code with python very much, but i keep learning it. Currently i try to code a discord bot with it since discord bots are a great project to start in several coding languages like JavaScript, Java and C++ for example.

# Next.js and Angular
I try to learn both of these frameworks. Next.js is often used by many programmers and Angular is often used in large companies. 

# Discord.js and Sapphire Framework
Discord.js is the base for the more advanced Sapphire framework. I mostly use discord.js since i started with it and im fine with it. Almost every project i coded with discord.js is public on GitHub and everyone can use the code as long as it follows the license mentioned in the repository. My verified bot [Nexus](https://github.com/cptcr/nexus) is also public on GitHub. Also i have a advanced base handler for discord bots which can handle components, prefix commands, slash commands, events and much more! Might check it out [here](https://github.com/cptcr/discord-bot-handler). Also the most popular database types (like mongoose, redis...) are supported in it and i try to add more and more to provide a user friendly environment. I hope you enjoy it

# HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Sometimes i just code basic games and websites in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently Open-Source projects are the Pong game and an Aerospace Shooter game. You can test them at https://cptcr.cc/pong and https://cptcr.cc/space :D

# What projects do i currently work on?
- Database System using fs
- Nexus discord bot using discord.js
- Discord bot handler 
- Web games
- APIs using the express npm
